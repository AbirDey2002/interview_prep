    "| Component | What to Say |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Situation** | \"Manual test case writing for every new document, CR, or BRD was taking QA teams **weeks** — it was a bottleneck in every release cycle.\" |\n",
    "| **Task** | \"I was tasked to build an AI-powered system **from scratch** that could automate test case generation with maximum coverage and minimal human intervention.\" |\n",
    "| **Action** | *(see breakdown below)* |\n",
    "| **Result** | \"Reduced test case generation from **weeks to minutes**, with active work underway to achieve full **E2E automated execution** via Playwright.\" |\n",

    "### 🔬 The Action — Say It Like This:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"I designed and built Digital Expert as a **multi-agent orchestration system**. Each agent has a specialized role — document parsing, requirement extraction, test case generation, coverage validation — and they work in a coordinated pipeline to process any incoming document like a BRD or CR.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"The key innovation was how we **structured the knowledge**. Instead of storing test cases as flat text, we decomposed every test step into **Entity-Relationship Triplets** — essentially a knowledge graph where each node is a state or entity, and edges represent transitions or actions.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"This means for any test case, you can define a **start node and an end node**, and the system traverses the graph to reconstruct or generate the full test path — with minimum human interference. It makes the system modular, reusable, and highly traceable.\"*\n",

    "### 🧵 Active Threads (Show You're Still Building)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Thread | What It Does | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **ER Triplet Graph Traversal** | Decomposes test steps into graph nodes, traversable from start → end node | Enables reusability, traceability & HITL reduction |\n",
    "| **Agentic Screen Traversal** | Agent navigates UI screens autonomously to understand application flow | Removes need for manual screen mapping |\n",
    "| **Playwright Script Generation** | Auto-generates E2E test scripts from the traversal output | Closes the loop — from document to executable test |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ One-Liner for Impression\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"I built a system where you feed in a business document and get back executable, graph-structured test cases — and we're now closing the loop by having agents traverse the UI and write the Playwright scripts themselves.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Follow-Up Questions to Prep For\n",
    "\n",
    "| Question | Quick Answer |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| *What agents are in the orchestration?* | Parser agent, requirement extractor, test generator, coverage validator, review agent |\n",
    "| *Why ER Triplets over flat test cases?* | Graph structure enables traversal, reuse across test cases, and minimal regeneration |\n",
    "| *How do you ensure coverage?* | Each requirement maps to nodes in the graph — coverage = % of nodes exercised |\n",
    "| *What's the HITL reduction goal?* | Near-zero human intervention from document ingestion to Playwright script execution |\n",
    "| *What docs does it support?* | BRDs, CRs, functional specs, user stories — any structured/semi-structured requirement doc |\n",
